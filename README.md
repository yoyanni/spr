### Scissors Paper Rock project for the "The Odin Project"

I will be making a "Scissors Paper Rock" game, it will initially run only in the console but I will be creating a GUI so its easier to use.

## Console Version

# "Create computer choice" commit

I was able to create the function **getComputerChoice** by using the **Math** functions, **floor** and **random**. That helped me get the "random" numbers that would be the choice of the computer and also the array index that would bring back "Scissors", "Paper" or "Rock".

Lastly it console.logs the result for now to confirm the result is a valid option.
